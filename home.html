<h2 class="subhead">Dept. Of AUTOMOBILE ENGINEERING:</h2>
<p><blockquote>Automotive engineering is a branch of mechanical engineering that concerns the design, development and manufacture of cars, trucks, motorcycles and other motor vehicles. Automotive engineers also design and test the many subsystems or components that comprise a motorized vehicle.Very few universities offer a bachelor's degree in automotive engineering. Consequently, many prospective automotive engineers earn a bachelor's degree in mechanical engineering from a university that also offers specialized courses in automotive engineering. However, there are plenty of universities offer master's degrees in automotive engineering.</blockquote></p>
